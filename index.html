  <p class="gar">These garlic and Parmesan cheese dinner rolls are really great â€“ crusty and cheesy 
    on the outside, tender and garlicky inside, and visually gorgeous.</p> 
    <p class="swe">This dough makes wonderful dinner rolls but can also be used to make cinnamon 
      rolls. Mixing it in your bread machine but bake the rolls in the oven. They're light,
       soft and sweet. </p>
       <p class="sou">This is an awesome dinner on a cold winter night. It is inexpensive and a great way 
        for the kids to take in some vegetables without any fuss. It's great served with warm bread and butter. </p>
