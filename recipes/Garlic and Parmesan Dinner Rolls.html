    <h3>steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix yeast, 1/2 cup of flour, sugar, and warm water in a bowl. Cover and <br> 
            let rest in a warm place until bubbling, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Stir in salt, olive oil, and egg. Mix thoroughly and stir in remaining 1 3/4 cup <br>
            flour to form a loose, sticky dough that pulls away from the sides of the <br>
            bowl. Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in <br>
            size, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. </li>
            <br>
        <li>Punch down and scrape the dough from the sides of the bowl. Turn onto a <br>
            lightly floured surface. Sprinkle with more flour and shape into a rectangle. <br>
            Roll out to an approximately 10x12-inch rectangle, about 1/2-inch thick. <br>
            Brush with melted butter; sprinkle with garlic, Parmagiano-Reggiano <br>
            cheese, black pepper, cayenne, and parsley.
        </li><br>
        <li>Press flat one long edge of the rectangle and brush with water. From the <br>
            opposite end, roll evenly into a log. Press the seam together to seal.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Cut into 8 rolls. Transfer to a baking sheet, cut side up. If necessary, cut an <br>
                'X' in the top of each roll to expose filling.</li><br>
                <li>Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li><br>
                <li>Brush each roll with olive oil. Sprinkle with more cheese. Cover and let rise <br>
                    until slightly puffed, about 20 to 30 minutes.</li><br>
                    <li>Bake in preheated oven until the tops are golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li><br>
